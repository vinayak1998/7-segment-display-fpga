# 7-segment-display-fpga
Design and implement a Seven Segment Display available on the BASYS3 board (FPGA) in VHDL

The aim of this exercise is to learn how to use 4-digit seven segment display available on the BASYS3
board. It involves designing and implementing a circuit to display 16-bit binary number set on the slide
switches as a 4 digit hexadecimal number (number with base 16).
